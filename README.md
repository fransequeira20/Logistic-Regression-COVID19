# Logistic Regression and Fractal Geometry

This Jupyter Notebook was made for the final project in the class "Classical Mechanics 2" and we focus on the use of non linear equations to estimate the beahavior of future COVID cases in Costa Rica.

We used a logistic regression model to predict future COVID cases and we also used fractal geometry to make a map of COVID cases in the GAM (Grand Metropolitan Area) and calculated the Minkowski-Boulingand dimension in order to compare this value with other countries like Italy, Spain and Germany.
